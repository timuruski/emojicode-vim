# emojicode.vim

Vim configuration for working with [Emojicode](http://www.emojicode.org). The
only feature included right now is the compiler.

To run an Emojicode file you can use `:make`, this both compiles and executes
the resulting file, making it easier to do development.


## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/timuruski/emojicode-vim.git
